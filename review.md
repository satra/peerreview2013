#Reinventing scientific peer review through collaborative technologies

In this article, we provide a brief history of peer review together with the demands placed on the process and the role it has played and describe how this process can be refined using collaborative technologies, in particular those that allow for software review.

### Brief history of peer review

According to [Spier (2002)][spier_2002], the first documented evidence of peer review is presented in a book called "Ethics of the Physician" by Ishap bin Ali Al Rahwi (CE 854 - 931). According to the book, a physician's notes on a patient were reviewed by a local council after the patient had been cured or had died. On the basis of the review, the practicing physician could be sued for damages for maltreatment. Spier goes on to note that the Royal Society of Edinburgh adopted a review process as early as 1731 involving a select group of "knowledgeable members", who made influential recommendations to the editor. It was only near the middle of the 20th century and with increasing specialization of materials submitted and a lack of publication space that journals started seeking assistance from a group of reviewers outside the society to restrict publications to materials of the highest quality. 

Through history, changes in the review system have often paralleled the evolution of technology. The printing press, the typewriter and the photocopier have all enabled easier dissemination of materials whether to readers or reviewers. This trend has continued with the advent of the Internet and has enabled alternate forms of collaborative reviewing, whether for the web in general (e.g., reddit.com) or for specialized domains of knowledge (e.g., arXiv.org, wikipedia.org, stackoverflow.com, mathoverflow.net). However, the review process has largely remained opaque, has not changed significantly since the middle of the 20th century and journal prestige has become a proxy for scientific quality. Indeed, it can be questioned if veracity or reproducibility was ever meant to be evaluated as part of the review process. According to the statement of the Royal society of Edinburgh:
 
> __ The sanction which the Society gives to the work now published under its auspices, extends only to the novelty, ingenuity or importance of the several memoirs which it contains. Responsibility concerning the truth of facts, the soundness of reasoning, in the accuracy of calculations is wholly disclaimed: and must rest alone, on the knowledge, judgement, or ability of the authors who have respectfully furnished such communications [(Kronick, 1990)][kronick_1990]. __

Although such intent may have been part of the earliest forms of peer review, most scholars of the review system would agree that peer-review extends the expertise available to the editor to detect mistakes and filter the increasing number of submissions in terms of quality and improves the readability of the work. Furthermore, as noted by [Rennie (2003)][rennie_2003], peer review guarantees "an environment of unrestrained criticism", but the criticisms themselves are, in most cases, not available as part of the scientific record. 

Herein, we argue that publications, like software, are artifacts of intellectual inquisition and the correctness or reproducibility of the work is the very basis on which "novelty, ingenuity or importance" can and should be judged. Like software, publications can be reviewed using approaches developed for software review and social collaboration models that leverage technology currently available and only post-publication peer review can provide a retrospective view of the ongoing evolution of the scientific process. 

### Objectives of peer review
A process can only be refined if its desired outcomes are clearly defined. Over the centuries peer review has not always had a clear definition of outcome. As noted previously, different scientific societies and journals have had different interpretations of the role of peer review. Most historians and scholars of peer review agree that the process serves as a filter on scientific output, to collect as part of the scientific record those results and opinions deemed novel and important. And in this, peer review has primarily not evolved.

The ease of information storage and dissemination through the web, the proliferation of journals and the increasing trend towards computational processes being an integral part of research requires a re-evaluation of the objectives of peer review. 

1. Correctness/Soundness

   Evaluating whether a paper meets this objective requires determining whether appropriate processing and statistical methods were used and/or logical arguments are being made.

2. Reproducibility/Reliability
  
	The reproducibility of the paper

3. Impact 
4. Tagging/Scope
5. Ongoing re-evaluation
